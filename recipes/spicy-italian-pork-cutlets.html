<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious garlic and fresh tomato sauce covers tender pork cutlets. Serve with crusty bread, a leafy salad, and maybe
    a side of buttered pasta with a little of the sauce on top. Terrific and fast.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 raw chop with refuse, 120 g; (blank) 4.225 ounces boneless pork chops, pounded to 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, diced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Steps 1</li>
        <p>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season the pork chops with salt and pepper, and quickly
        sear on both sides. Remove from heat, and set aside.</p>
        <li>Steps 2</li>
        <p>Heat the remaining olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat, and saute the garlic about 30 seconds. Mix in the
        tomato, chicken broth, wine, parsley, and red pepper flakes. Cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <p>Return the pork chops to the skillet, and continue cooking 5 to 10 minutes, to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F
        (63 degrees C). Serve pork with the tomato and broth mixture from the skillet.</p>
